# Educational Challenges Faced by Malaysian Secondary School Students

## Problem Statement

Secondary school students in Malaysia face several key challenges when making
critical educational and career decisions:

1. **Lack of Structured Planning for Subject Selection**
   - Students often choose elective subjects without understanding their
     implications for future career paths
   - Limited guidance on which subjects align with specific career trajectories
   - Decisions frequently made based on peer influence rather than individual
     aptitude or career goals

2. **Career Path Uncertainty**
   - Insufficient exposure to diverse career options beyond traditional
     professions
   - Limited understanding of emerging industries and future job market trends
   - Difficulty connecting academic subjects to real-world career applications

3. **Parental Concerns About Job Market Demand**
   - Parents lack access to current data on job market trends and employment
     prospects
   - Disconnect between parental career expectations and actual market demands
   - Pressure on students to pursue "safe" career paths regardless of personal
     interest or aptitude

4. **Absence of Centralized Information on Higher Education**
   - Fragmented information about post-SPM pathways including foundation
     programs, diploma courses, and degree options
   - Difficulty comparing institutions, programs, and their entry requirements
   - Limited awareness of TVET options and their career pathways

## Context: Malaysian Education System

### SPM and Subject Selection

The Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) is a national examination taken by Form 5
students (equivalent to O-Levels). It includes:

- Compulsory subjects: Bahasa Malaysia, English, Mathematics, Science, History,
  and Islamic/Moral Education
- Elective subjects that vary by stream (Science, Arts, Technical, etc.)

The selection of elective subjects significantly impacts future educational and
career opportunities, yet many students make these choices without adequate
information or guidance.

### Post-SPM Pathways

After SPM, students can pursue various pathways:

- Form 6 (STPM) - equivalent to A-Levels
- Matriculation programs
- Foundation courses at private institutions
- Diploma programs
- Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)

### TVET in Malaysia

- Over 1,000 TVET institutions nationwide, accommodating around 230,000 students
- Programs offered at certificate, diploma, and degree levels
- Accreditation provided by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) and
  Department for Skill Development (DSD)
- Growing demand for TVET graduates, with projections indicating a need for an
  additional 1.3 million TVET workers

## Target Users
